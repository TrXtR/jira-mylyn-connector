This is a work in progress fork/attempt to make the Mylyn JIRA connector working again on Eclipse (4.8).

It works with JIRA 6.3.1 on-premise and with Atlassian Cloud according to my tests.

If you want to use Atlassian Cloud, use an API token as the password in the configuration of the task repository : [API tokens](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html)
